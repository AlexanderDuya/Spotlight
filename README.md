# 📸 Spotlight — A Social Sharing App Built with React Native & Expo

**Spotlight** is a modern mobile app built using **React Native with Expo**, designed to let users share, comment, and bookmark posts. It combines a smooth user experience with real-time updates, secure authentication, and a clean visual style. (aka an instagram clone)

This project is where I learned how to apply my **React skills in a mobile environment**—building everything from UI components to backend integration.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

I built Spotlight as a self-learning project to dive into mobile app development using React Native. Through this app, I learned:

- How to structure and style mobile UIs  
- How to manage authenticated users with Clerk  
- How to store and retrieve data in real time using Convex  
- How to design mobile-friendly interaction flows like bookmarking and commenting
